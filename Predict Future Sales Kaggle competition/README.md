My first ever participation in Kaggle competition to Predict Future sales!!

I tried using basic forecasting algorithms like Linear regression, random forest, XGBoost algorithm, Analysed on Time series based algorithms to predict future sales.
Finally, LSTM based deep learning model had higher capability to predict the sales accurately with RMSE score of 1.03810.

Submissions.csv in the folder is the result obtained by running LSTM model.
